# Simplified Common English
English is the most used language in the world. 1.5 billion people out of the 8 billion people speak English. That's nearly 19% which is far more than any other language. The problem is that English is notorius for being a very hard language to learn because it has a lot of very random rules about grammar and pronunciation. Overall English is a very ambiguous language that even native speakers struggle with. My goal is to create a simplified version of English that's very similiar to regular english, but it much easier to learn. Why? Mostly because I thought it would be a great opportunity to learn Tensorflow for one to one translation, but also because I think it's cool concept.

# Examples of Regular English
(The amount of ways to make things plural is horrendous)  
plural of rat is rats  
plural of mouse is mice  
plural of dependency is dependencies  
plural of cactus is cacti  
plural of mass is masses  
plural of fish is fishes  

(why isn't it loffter or daffter?)  
laughter = laff-ter  
daughter = d-ahh-ter  

(the punctuation is not part of the quote yet it goes inside the quotes)  
He said "it is proper for a sentence's punctuation to be inside of a quote."  

(adding an e to the end of the word somehow changes the pronunciation of a letter that isn't even connected to it)  
Tim = tim  
time = t-eye-m  

(obviously it makes sense to go medium, small, big instead of small, medium, big)  
month/day/year  

(is the party at 7:30 AM or 7:30 PM?)  
The party is at 7:30  

(why does c make an s sound? Why do we need k if we already have c?)  
like - l-eye-cuh  
lice - l-eye-suh  

# Simplified Plurals
To make any word plural add an "ses" unless it already ends in an "s" in which case add an "es"  
rat -> ratses  
mouse -> mouses  
dependency -> dependencyses  
cactus -> cactuses  
mass -> masses  
fish -> fishses  

# Simplified Letters
In english each letter can have nearly a dozen different pronounciations which is terrible. My descriptions of the letters are in terms of regular American english. Therefore I will make each letter only have a single pronunciation. Each letter only makes its lowercase sound. To make an uppercase sound simply put the letter twice. Note that because we already have c, k becomes "ch". Also I changed W. When two sounds that don't flow together very well are side by side can you smear the sounds together. Here are the only sounds that letters can make:  
a -> ah  
b -> buh  
c -> cuh  
d -> duh  
e -> eh  
f -> fh  
g -> guh  
h -> hu  
i -> ih  
j -> juh  
k -> ch  
l -> ull  
m -> mmm  
n -> nnn  
o -> aww  
p -> puh  
q -> quh  
r -> rrr  
s -> sss  
t -> tuh  
u -> uh  
v -> vvv  
w -> makes the sound of the o in "or"  
x -> xxx  
y -> yyy  
z -> zzz  
  
aa -> ayy  
bb -> bee  
cc -> see  
dd -> dee  
ee -> eee  
ff -> eff  
gg -> jee  
hh -> ayych  
ii -> eye  
jj -> jay  
kk -> kay  
ll -> ell  
mm -> em  
nn -> en  
oo -> oh  
pp -> pee  
qq -> kyu  
rr -> arr  
ss -> ess  
tt -> tee  
uu -> yoo  
vv -> vee  
ww -> wuh  
xx -> ex  
yy -> why  
zz -> zee  

## Spelling and Pronunciation
I figured it would be easier to change the spelling of words rather than their pronunciation. Therefore you spell any word you can literally just sound it out like a toddler. This also means there are multiple spellings for each word which isn't great, but it's better than having to learn a new pronunciation for each word.

## Changing verbs into nouns
To change a verb into a noun add "in" or "er".  
run -> runer (a noun doing the act of to run)  
run -> runin (the act of to run as a noun)  

## Changing verbs to adjectives
To change a verb into an adjective add "ing" or "ed"  
run -> runing (describes a noun to be in the act of to run)  
learn -> learned (describes a noun to have completed the act of to learn)  

## Changing adjectives into adverbs
To change an adjective into an adverb add "ly"  
gentle -> gentlely (describes the manner in which something is done)  
runing -> runingly (idk what it means, but it's a valid word)  
learned -> learnedly (idk what it means, but it's a valid word)  

## Changing nouns into adjectives
To change a noun into an adjective ad "al"
environment -> evironmental (relating to an environment)
experiment -> experimental (relating to an experiment)

## Differing levels of adjectives
Use "yuh" and "est" to denote more and most degrees of an adjective.  
high -> highyuh (more high and just high)  
high -> highest (the most degree of high possible)  
many -> manyuh (more many than just many; note that since it ends in "y" we don't add an extra "y")  
many -> manyest (the most amount of many possible)  

## Reverse the meaning of a word
To reverse the meaning of a word add "un" to the start of it  
screw -> unscrew  
capitate -> uncapitate
